# Deep Learning Classes
Finally I am preparing a repository for my deep learning classes. This is an on-going process I plan to finish it in June 2020. 
By now I will just add tasks 'online' when necessary. I will try to add both English and Polish version of the notebooks. The 
'main' version is always English.' 

In my course I based on great Andrew Ng courses as well as on various blogs and Kaggle examples. I will do by mest to give correct credit to all the authors and people that contributed to these notebooks directly or indirectly. Currently this is test version only, and my original code is in a mess. If I forgot about someone just let me know.

**This repository is only a part of the course, prepared for sharing it with my students. Feel free to use it as you wish, but without the rest of the course it may not be useful for you.**
